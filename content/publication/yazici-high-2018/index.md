abstract: "This paper focuses on achieving high dynamic range pixel by using multiple pre-amplifiers in the pixel. There are two input circuits which are optimized for different signal levels inside the pixels. A smart circuit mechanism, inside each pixel, decides the best input circuit according to the incoming light level. In short, an individual pixel has the ability to select the best input amplifier circuit that performs the best SNR for the incoming signal level. A prototype chip is designed in 0.18 um CMOS technology. Pixel can achieve minimum 8.6 e-input referred noise and 98.9 dB dynamic range. In room temperature, power consumption of 2.8 uW is measured for the pixel."
