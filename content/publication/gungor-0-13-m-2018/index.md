abstract: "This paper presents a W-band LNA implemented in 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The designed LNA has a peak gain of 20.5dB at 80GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth greater than 25GHz. The simulated noise figure (NF) is lower than 6.2 dB across the entire W-band with a minimum of 5 dB at 93 GHz. The LNA has input P1dB of -16dBm at 94 GHz. The total quiescent DC power consumption of the designed LNA is 16.6mW with a 1.3V supply voltage. Inductors were utilized in matching networks instead of transmission lines to reduce the chip area. The total integrated circuit occupies an area of 0.33 mm2, and the effective chip area is 0.2mm2, excluding the pads. Simulation results indicate that the designed LNA is suitable to be used in a radiometer that has NETD smaller than 0.5 K."
