abstract: "The present invention presents unit cell architecture for infrared imaging, which has two input stages covering for both low and high light levels, and automatic input selection circuitry inside to extend dynamic range. The invention mainly helps to extend dynamic range of near visible (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR) image sensors by improving SNR value. The idea is applicable to not only infrared bands including NIR, SWIR, MWIR and LWIR but also full spectrum light."
