abstract: "This paper presents and discusses the cryogenic temperature (77K) measurement results of a digital readout integrated circuit (DROIC) for a 32x32 long wavelength infrared pixel sensor array designed in 90nm CMOS process. The chip achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 58dB with a charge handling capacity of 2.03Ge- at cryogenic temperature with 1.3mW of power dissipation. The performance of the readout is discussed in terms of power dissipation, charge handling capacity and SNR considering the fact that the process library models are not optimized for cryogenic temperature operation of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) devices. These results provide an insight to foresee the design confrontations due to non-optimized device models for cryogenic temperatures particularly for short channel devices"
