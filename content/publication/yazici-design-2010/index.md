abstract: "Design of a silicon readout integrated circuit (ROIC) for LWIR HgCdTe Focal Plane is presented. ROIC incorporates time delay integration (TDI) functionality over seven elements with a supersampling rate of three, increasing SNR and the spatial resolution. Novelty of this topology is inside TDI stage; integration of charges in TDI stage implemented in current domain by using switched current structures that reduces required area for chip and improves linearity performance. ROIC, in terms of functionality, is capable of bidirectional scan, programmable integration time and 5 gain settings at the input. Programming can be done parallel or serially with digital interface. ROIC can handle up to 3.5V dynamic range with the input stage to be direct injection (DI) type. With the load being 10pF capacitive in parallel with 1MΩ resistance, output settling time is less than 250nsec enabling the clock frequency up to 4MHz. The manufacturing technology is 0.35μm, double poly-Si, four-metal (3 metals and 1 top metal) 5V CMOS process."
