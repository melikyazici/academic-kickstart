Some mobile operators provide limited 5G coverage for their users and many more of them testing their 5G infrastructure. We are very close to 5G revolution but not quite soon. These are only preliminary versions of 5G communication which operates around 3-6 GHz. True potential of 5G will be observed mmWave frequency bands. 

This projects proposes adaptive self-interference method to be used in 5G full duplex operation at 28 GHz. Project aims to develop 5G front end core chip with smart full duplex functionality using SiGe BiCMOS technology.
