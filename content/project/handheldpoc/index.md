Point-of-Care devices are widely used for simple diagnostics and patient monitoring. One of the most popular and well known PoC is a glucometer. It helps to monitor glucose level in the blood. People with diabetes use it to check and maintain their conditions. It is very easy to use and it doesn`t require any special medical skill to use it.

In this project students will develop capacitive readout circuit that read capacitive changes from inter-digitated circular electrode arrays which is used for detection of cancer and cardiovascular biomarkers. These changes will be translated into risk levels. Detection mechanism is based on preactivating sensors with antibodies and capturing capacitance change due to affinity-based electron exchange in between antibodies/antigens and electrons. Also project includes mobile phone interface and mechanical interface developments as well as circuit design.

courses are encouraged to apply for this project.
