Oscilloscope is the most fundamental electronic measurement equipment which displays voltage value of the signal as a function of time. It is extensively used by scientist, electrical and computer engineers. Also, it the first complex electrical equipment that EE students met during their education. One of the most critical component of the oscilloscope is ADC which determines the sampling rate. Other fundamental components are attenuator, amplifier and memory.

Purpose of this project is to understand working principles of oscilloscope and to realize a working oscilloscope using an FPGA. Students should be familiar with digital design fundamentals and one of the hardware description languages. They will display the output using VGA port of the FPGA.
